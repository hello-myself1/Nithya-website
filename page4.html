                <h1>Maui Dolphins</h1>
                <p>
                   Maui dolphins are a subspecies of the Hector’s Dolphin. This means they are the smallest and rarest dolphin in the world!
                </p>
                <p>
                    They can be found on the west coast of New Zealand's North Island and their diet consists of small red cod, flatfish, and
                    arrow squid. Their appearance is quite similar to Hector's Dolphin, being larger and having a longer and wider snout.
                    However, they share the same color correlation to Hector’s dolphin, needing genetic analysis to properly distinguish them.

                <h1>Threats</h1>
                <p>
                    Maui Dolphins are considered nationally critical, meaning they are severely endangered and have a high risk of facing extinction.
                    There are only 48 - 64 dolphins older than 1 year of age. They are also the most endangered dolphin in the world!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Maui dolphins face the same threats as Hector’s Dolphins, entanglement in fishing nets and deaths caused by toxoplasmosis.
                    Some other known threats include pollution, plastic debris, and interactions with boats / tourism. Organochlorines,
                    found in pesticides of building materials, find their way to the ocean and affect breeding of marine mammal species such as
                    Maui Dolphins, in some cases resulting in sterility. Maui Dolphins can also potentially become entangled in drifting plastic
                    debris and could affect their ability to find food and escape predators.

                <p>
                    A few ways we could help with the growing risk of extinction of the Maui Dolphin, is similar to Hector’s Dolphin, safe interactions
                    by following regulations and disposing of cat faeces. Some other things could include:

                        Also, contact if you see any dolphins in the North Island: entire south and east coast, inside and harbour past its entrances.
                        South Island: Top of South Island (excluding Queen Charlotte sound and Golden Bay) Be ready to give them the date, time, location,
                        and number of dolphins (and estimated size) Please take photos/videos as well if possible.
