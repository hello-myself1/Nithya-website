            <h2>
                As Kiwis, and part of the Mount Roskill community, It is our responsibility to show Kaitiakitanga towards our wildlife and
                resources. We should feel proud to be from New Zealand and ready to do what we can to protect native wildlife potentially
                facing risks of extinction. Please, grab your friends around school and implement these actions so we can save our endemic species.
                Make sure to follow the right protocol when approaching dolphins on your boat and make sure to pick up after your cat!
                Also, spread awareness around the community and remind people how important it is to protect and care for these species.
                These small actions can make a big difference, allowing more people to be educated and convinced to take action. Start implementing today!
