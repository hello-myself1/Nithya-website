                <h1>Hector's dolphin</h1>
                <p>
                    Hector’s dolphins are endemic to coastal regions of New Zealand, usually found on the west coast of the North Island.
                    They've always had a slow population growth, their maximum growth rate being said to be estimated between 1.8-4.9% per year.
                    They are one of the smallest and rarest marine dolphin species. They are small, have white and grey markings, and are most
                    distinctively known for their rounded dorsal fin that looks like one of Mickey Mouse's ears. They are considered nationally vulnerable,
                    with about 15,000 dolphins older than 1 year of age.
                </p>
                <h1>Threats:</h1>
                <p>One of the main causes of the deaths of Hector’s dolphins is through the result of entanglement in nets. Dolphins are mammals, which
                    means they breathe air and can hold their breath underwater for up to 2 minutes, after which they need to come up to the surface to
                    take breaths of air, through their blowhole. So when Hector’s dolphins dive underwater, they can get caught in gillnets and trawl nets,
                    being unable to escape, and leading to suffocation and drowning. This is one of the main reasons for their unsustainable decrease in
                    population size.

                <h1>How to help:</h1>
                <p>The next time you or your family are engaging in boats and come across dolphins, make sure to drop down to wake speed making sure your boat isn’t
                    a threat to them. There are specific regulations you can be aware of and follow in order to be respectful to the dolphins. They include:
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Approach dolphins slowly or wait for them to approach you first.</li>
                        <li>Avoid obstructing their path by changing directions. Maintain a parallel, straight course.</li>
                        <li>Remember: Swimming with dolphins, especially juveniles, is almost always prohibited.</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>Dispose of cat faeces: Make sure to clean up after your cat, throwing away cat faeces (cat poop) in the bin. This is because toxoplasmosis,
                    a disease caused by a parasite and is actively a known cause for the deaths of Hector’s Dolphin, can be found in cat poop. Cats are the primary
                    source for this parasite and can be a threat to Hector's dolphins, causing abnormal behaviour and affecting their ability to hunt. So make sure to
                    clean up after your cat! At home, walking on the street, please throw the poop in the garbage as this simple act can reduce the amount of potential
                    threats on Hector’s Dolphin.
