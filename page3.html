                <h1>Sea Lions</h1>
                <p>
                    New Zealand sea lions, also once known as Hooker’s sealion, are a species of sea lion, part of the Otariidae family,
                    and endemic to New Zealand. They are one of the rarest sea lion species, with a population of only around 10,000.
                    Sea lions were nearly driven to extinction 150 years ago by human settlers, and now they are currently nationally endangered.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Their population has been declining in recent years in Auckland islands. They are native to New Zealand and us,
                    fellow Kiwi’s, should all contribute to protecting them, showing kindness and kaitiakitanga to our wild-life community.
                    New Zealand sea lions are apex predators, playing a vital role in the marine food chain. Without them, the ecosystem
                    could face disruptions, affecting predators  (orcas and sharks)and prey (fish and squid) of sea lions.

                <h1>Causes of population decline:</h1>
                <p>
                    When females are pregnant, they can only travel so far for foraging, meaning in an attempt to find food they instead get caught
                    up in squid trawl nets around the Auckland Islands.

                    Diseases: Multiple disease outbreaks have occurred over the years, decreasing the population of NZ sea lions. The first disease,
                    Campylobacter, to strike happened in 1998, reducing the sea lion pups’ population by more than 50% during their first months of
                    life and leading to the death of 20% of adult females. Another, different disease outbreak killed 32% of pups during their first
                    month of life in 2002 and 21% in 2003.

                    <li>By merch/donate from certified charities that help support marine reserves for endangered species.
                    <li>Keep an eye out for fishing boats in marine reserves or restricted fishing areas. Make reports through DOC hotline (0800 362 468).</li>
                    <li>Educate others on the subject of the severity of the situation.</li>
                    <li>Organise or join beach cleanups and make sure everyone collects their stuff at the end of a beach day.</li>
                    <li>Stop buying plastic because almost 8 million tonnes of plastic that is made ends up in the ocean, polluting rare habitats.</li>
                    <li>Don’t buy fish from fishing companies that support poaching of endangered species.</li>
                </ul>
